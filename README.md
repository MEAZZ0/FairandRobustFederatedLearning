# FairandRobustFederatedLearning
This work focuses on attacking the RFFL and exploit some weaknesses in the algorithm. We also incorporate robust aggregation to make more robust.
The original RFFL algorithm by the original authors is found in  https://github.com/XinyiYS/Robust-and-Fair-Federated-Learning
The one used here fixes an indexing issue leading to mixed reward assignment.
